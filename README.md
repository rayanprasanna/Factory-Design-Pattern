# Factory-Design-Pattern

It is a creational design pattern that talks about the creation of an object.The factory design pattern says that define an interface ( A java interface or
an abstract class) for creating object and let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.The factory method in the interface lets a class defers the
instantiation to one or more concrete subclasses. Since these design patterns talk about the instantiation of an object and so it comes under the category 
of creational design pattern. If we notice the name Factory method, that means there is a method which is a factory, and in general, factories are involved
with creational stuff and here with this, an object is being created. It is one of the best ways to create an object where object creation logic is hidden
from the client. Now Letâ€™s look at the implementation.

Implementation: 

    * Define a factory method inside an interface. 
    * Let the subclass implements the above factory method and decides which object to create. 
    * In Java, constructors are not polymorphic, but by allowing subclass to create an object, we are adding polymorphic behavior to the instantiation.
    In short, we are trying to achieve Pseudo polymorphism by letting the subclass to decide what to create, and so this Factory method is also called a 
    virtual constructor.
